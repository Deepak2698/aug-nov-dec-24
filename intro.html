            - What are Tags ?

                    Tags are enclosed between opening and closing angle brackets.
                    angle brackets are < and >
                    Example: <html>, <head>, <body>, <div>, <h1>, <p>, <a>, <img> etc.    
        
            - What are Elements ?
                    Elements are the building blocks of HTML.
                    Anything that is enclosed between opening and closing tags is called an element.
                    Example: <html> </html>, <head> </head>, <body> </body>, <div> </div>, <h1> </h1>, <p> </p>, <a> </a>, <img> </img>

            - What are Attributes ?
                    Attributes are the additional information about an element.
                    Attributes are always specified in the opening tag.
                    Most of the attributes have a Key:value pair.
                    Example: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
                    In this example, href is the key of attribute and https://www.google.com is the value of the attribute.
